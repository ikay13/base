# BASE Principles

## Core Laws

1. **If it's not current, it's harmful.** Stale context documents feed AI bad information. Maintenance isn't optional.
2. **Every file earns its place.** If you can't explain why it's here in 5 seconds, it moves or dies.
3. **Archive > delete.** When in doubt, archive. You can always delete later. You can't un-delete.
4. **The workspace is the product.** Treat it like production code, not a scratch pad.
5. **Clean as you go.** The best time to file something correctly is when you create it. The second best time is now.
6. **Scaffold generates manifest. Manifest drives everything.** One configuration point. No manual bookkeeping.
7. **Tools register themselves.** PAUL projects auto-register with BASE. No human memory required.

## Drift Score

Drift is the gap between documented state and actual state. Measured in days-overdue across all tracked areas.

- **0** — Everything current. Workspace is clean.
- **1-7** — Minor drift. Normal during execution sprints. Fix at next groom.
- **8-14** — Moderate drift. Context documents are likely misleading AI. Groom soon.
- **15+** — Critical drift. Sessions are operating on stale context. Groom NOW.

## Maintenance Cadence

| What | Default Cadence | Override |
|------|----------------|---------|
| ACTIVE.md | Every session or weekly | workspace.json |
| BACKLOG.md | Weekly groom | workspace.json |
| Project directory | Monthly | workspace.json |
| Tools/MCP | Monthly | workspace.json |
| System layer | Monthly | workspace.json |
| Full audit | Quarterly or after major shifts | On demand |

## Backlog Rules

Items have time-based properties enforced by grooming:

- **Added** — auto-set when item enters backlog
- **Review-by** — priority-based: High=7d, Medium=14d, Low=30d
- **Staleness** — 2x review-by threshold. Auto-archive if reached without action.

During groom: items past review-by surface as "decide or kill." Items past staleness auto-archive with a note.

## Graduation Flow

Backlog items don't sit forever. They graduate to ACTIVE.md when the operator is ready to work on them.

```
BACKLOG (waiting review)
  → ACTIVE.md TASKS (standalone, bounded work items)
  → ACTIVE.md PROJECT (complex work warranting its own project entry)
  → DONE (closed with outcome + date)
```

**TASKS vs PROJECTS:** A task is bounded — it has a finish line. "Extract .mcp.json secrets" is a task. "Build the CARL MCP server" might start as a task but could become a project if it grows. The operator decides during groom.

**Graduation is never automatic.** The groom flow asks explicitly: "Ready to work on any backlog items?" The operator decides what graduates and where it lands.

**Items can also move backward:** An ACTIVE task that loses priority can return to backlog. A project that stalls can move to DEFERRED. Nothing is permanent.

## Scaffold Modes

BASE scaffold operates in two modes:

- **Standard** (`/base:scaffold`) — Data layer only. Creates `.base/` with workspace.json, STATE.md, ROADMAP.md. Scans and tracks what exists. Framework-agnostic.
- **Full** (`/base:scaffold --full`) — Data layer + operational templates. Creates ACTIVE.md, BACKLOG.md from templates. Offers CLAUDE.md audit. Sets up symlinks. The "batteries included" version for AI builders who want the full system.

Standard mode works for any workspace. Full mode provides Chris's proven operational structure.

## File Location

BASE operates strictly out of `.base/`. All state files (ACTIVE.md, BACKLOG.md, STATE.md, workspace.json, ROADMAP.md) live in `.base/`. Symlinks at workspace root are a **migration tool only** — offered when existing references (CLAUDE.md @mentions, hooks) would break. New installations never need symlinks. `.base/` is the canonical location.
