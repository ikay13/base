## What is BASE?

BASE keeps your Claude Code workspace from becoming a mess. It scaffolds structure, tracks workspace health, surfaces the right context automatically, and tells you when things go stale — so you spend time building, not maintaining.

**The core pattern:** structured JSON files (data surfaces) + lightweight Python hooks that inject them into Claude's context every session. Claude always knows what's active, what's queued, and where satellites stand — without you having to say it.

---

## Install

```bash
npx @chrisai/base --global --workspace
```

| Flag | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `--global` | Install commands + framework to `~/.claude` |
| `--workspace` | Install workspace layer (`.base/`) in current directory |
| `--local` | Install commands to `./.claude` instead of global |
| `--config-dir <path>` | Custom Claude config directory |
| `--workspace-dir <path>` | Target a specific workspace path |

**Common flows:**

```bash
# Full install — global commands + current workspace
npx @chrisai/base --global --workspace

# Already have global? Just wire a new workspace
npx @chrisai/base --workspace

# Global only — set up each workspace later with /base:scaffold
npx @chrisai/base --global
```

## Commands

After install, open Claude Code and run `/base:scaffold` to complete setup.

| Command | Description |
|---------|------------|
| `/base:scaffold` | Set up BASE in a new or existing workspace |
| `/base:pulse` | Daily workspace health briefing |
| `/base:groom` | Weekly maintenance cycle |
| `/base:audit` | Deep workspace optimization |
| `/base:status` | Quick health check |
| `/base:history` | Workspace evolution timeline |
| `/base:audit-claude-md` | Audit CLAUDE.md, generate recommended version |
| `/base:carl-hygiene` | CARL domain maintenance |
| `/base:surface create` | Create a new data surface (guided) |
| `/base:surface convert` | Convert a markdown file to a data surface |
| `/base:surface list` | Show all registered data surfaces |

---

## Data Surfaces

The core primitive. A data surface is a structured JSON file + a Python hook that injects it into Claude's context every session. Any persistent data you want Claude to passively know about becomes a surface.

```
workspace.json registers it → hook reads it → Claude knows it
```

**Built-in surfaces:**
- `active.json` — Current projects, status, blockers, deadlines
- `backlog.json` — Future work queue, ideas, deferred items

**Create your own:**
```
/base:surface create
```
Guided schema builder. Point it at any data you want surfaced — contacts, clients, API keys, anything. BASE generates the JSON schema, the hook, and wires it automatically.

---

## PAUL Satellite Integration

BASE auto-detects [PAUL](https://github.com/ChristopherKahler/paul) projects in your workspace. Every session, `satellite-detection.py` scans for `.paul/paul.json` files and registers any new projects in `workspace.json`. Weekly groom cycles check satellite health: stale loops, abandoned phases, overdue milestones.

No manual registration. It just works.

---

## Ecosystem

BASE is part of a three-layer workspace system:

| System | Role |
|--------|------|
| **BASE** | Workspace lifecycle — surfaces, grooming, drift detection |
| **CARL** | Dynamic rules engine — just-in-time rule injection |
| **PAUL** | Project orchestration — Plan → Apply → Unify loop |

Each is independent. Use one, some, or all.
